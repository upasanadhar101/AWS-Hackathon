# AWS-Hackathon
# Motivation of study- 
1. How the air quality is impacted post covid times with several countries imposing strict lockdown policies.
2. Can this be a future strategy to implement cleaner climate ??

# METHOD USED:  
Data visualization and Data analysis of temporal variation in Cumultaive average pollutant concentration through years of 2017 to 2020. 

We calculated the cumulative average concentartion of pollutants for each individual cities in different countries and observed how they changed through 2015 to 2020.
First we grouoed the dataset based on cities and found the mean concntration of pollutants for each cities in respective countries. The we used the rating to check the number of cities with low, moderate and high average pollutant concentrations and whether the number of cities falling in these crtieria increases or decreases through the years.

# RESULT:
